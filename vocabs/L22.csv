A 4200 system comes with a choice of a dual simultaneous frequency towfish available in either a stainless steel or lightweight aluminium housing depending on operational requirements. Customers can also choose between a rack mount or portable topside processor or a digital link to interface to 3rd party topsides and software. One of the unique features of the 4200 is the optional Multi-Pulse (MP) technology, which places two sound pulses in the water rather than one pulse like conventional side scan sonar systems. This allows the 4200 to be towed at speeds of up to 10 knots while still maintaining 100% bottom coverage. In addition, the MP technology will provide twice the resolution when operating at normal tow speeds, thus allowing for better target detection and classification ability. Frequency = choice of either 100/400, 300/600 or 300/900 kHz dual simultaneous; operating range (metres/side) = 500 m at 100 kHz, 230 m at 300 kHz, 150 m at 400 kHz, 120 m at 600 kHz, or 75 m at 900 kHz; the stainless steel housing is depth rated to 2000 m, and the aluminium housing is depth rated to 500 m."

The instrument may be mounted on a towed vehicle such as Chelsea Technologies Group's AQUAshuttle III, NvShuttle or SeaSoar, it can be deployed on buoys, on a mooring, or vertically in a profiling mode. The fluorimeter uses a pulsed light double beam technique. The pulsed technique allows virtually perfect discrimination to be achieved against ""steady"" ambient light signals since the light pulse is only two microseconds long, variations in ambient intensity due to wave glitter, etc. are considered ""steady"" by the high-speed processing circuits and are effectively rejected by the AQUAtracka. The double beam system allows the light intensity of the optical beam(X) returned from the specimen to be compared with the light intensity of the reference beam(Y) generated from the same pulsed light source. The outputs are then ratioed(X/Y) so that they are not affected by any variations in the flash lamp strength due to lamp ageing. The housing is constructed in titanium and the instrument is rated to 600m (option 6000m) and incorporates an optional ambient light baffling cowl. A fast response (300ms) platinum resistance Pt 100 Temperature Probe can also be included optionally. Using 360nm fluorescence the detection range is between 0.001 and 10 micrograms per litre of Carbazole. Using 440nm fluorescence the detection range is between 0.001 to 10 micrograms per litre Perylene. The operating temperature range of the instrument is -2 to +40 degrees Celsius."

Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation, NOAA, UNH Large Pelagics Center, and UM Maytag Chair of Ichthyology. ISIIS systems image organisms and particles in-situ as they swim or flow in between its two pods (fitted with a camera and illumination system). The instrument captures images of mostly undisturbed organisms, at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. ISIIS is an underwater imaging system for capturing in situ, real time images of marine zooplankton of relatively low abundance such as fish larvae and fragile gelatinous organisms. ISIIS imaging systems use industrial grade cameras. On towed sleds, they use a line-scan camera creating one single continuous image representing a real slice of the ocean. However, they can also be fitted with a classic area-scan camera if a system is to be used still (underwater monitoring station) or do slow vertical profiles. The ISIIS system utilizes a high-resolution line-scanning camera with a Light Emitting Diode (LED) light source, modified by plano-convex optics, to create a collimated light field to backlight a parcel of water. The imaged parcel of water passes between the forward portions of two streamlined pods (UW housings), and thereby remains unaffected by turbulence. The resulting very high-resolution image is of plankton in their natural position and orientation. When a sufficient volume of water is imaged this way, quantification of density and fine-scale distribution is possible. ISIIS is capable of imaging a maximum of 162 L of water per second (when flying at 5 knots) with a pixel resolution of 70 um, imaging particles from 1 mm to 13 cm in size."

SDN:L22::TOOL1852,http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1852/,Magee Scientific AE33 Aethalometer,"An instrument that collects and analyses aerosol particles continuously. It can be used for air quality monitoring; real-time source apportionment; emissions testing; climate change research; health effects research; and combustion research. Air is drawn through a spot on a filter tape at a measured flow rate. The tape is illuminated by light while sensitive detectors measure the intensities of light transmitted through the collecting spot and an un-exposed portion of the tape, acting as a reference. As optically absorbing material accumulates on the spot, the intensity of light transmitted through it gradually decreases. The decrease in light intensity from one measurement to the next is interpreted as an increase in collected material. This increased amount is divided by the known air-flow volume to calculate the concentration. In this model two sample spots are collected from the same input air stream with different accumulation rates and analysed simultaneously. The two results are combined mathematically to eliminate the ""Filter Loading Effect"" nonlinearity and accurately measure the aerosol concentration. Additionally, the analysis is made at 7 optical wavelengths spanning the spectrum from 370 nm to 950 nm. Increases in optical absorption at shorter wavelengths may be interpreted in terms of the presence of so-called ""Brown"" carbonaceous material, usually an indicator of emissions from biomass combustion. This instrument can be integrated with other instruments including: Total Carbon Analyzer TCA08 for OC/EC analysis; CO2 and meteorological sensors for additional data; and external pump for high altitude BC monitoring. The measurement wavelengths are: 370, 470, 520, 590, 660, 880 and 950 nm. The air flow set-points are: 2, 3, 4 and 5 LPM.

SDN:L22::TOOL0559,http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL0559/,GV Instruments Trace Gas Preconcentrator,"A gas chromatograph used for the isotope characterisation of N2O, CO2 and CH4. Gas samples can be injected either manually, using dual-ended sample bottles with valves, or using the fully automated inlet system. Manual selection of the gas to be analysed (CH4, CO2 or N2O) dictates the route the sample will travel through the instrument. For CO2 and N2O analysis, a sample is diverted by a helium gas via the gas selector valves, through a sequence of chemical traps which purify the sample. The sample is then cryogenically frozen twice to concentrate the trace gas. The sample is then separated using the poraplot-Q gas chromatograph (GC) column, ready for analysis. During CH4 analysis, the sample is transported through additional stages including, the oxidation of CO to CO2 by a Sofnocat catalyst, combustion in the furnace and an additional cryogenic trap is used. The instrument is designed to be coupled with the IsoPrime stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). The Trace Gas preconcentrator was originally manufactured by GV Instruments, but part of the business was sold to Isoprime Ltd (a group member of Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH) in 2008, who now manufacturer the Trace Gas preconcentrator."

The instrument consists of a nadir and limb scanning component. Measurements are performed by observing the atmosphere under different viewing angles. In Nadir Mode, global distribution (total column values) of the atmospheric trace gases, clouds and aerosols are observed. In this mode, the instrument is scanning across-track. To obtain the altitude distribution of trace gases, SCIAMACHY performs observations in limb over an altitude range of 100 km, with a vertical resolution of 3 km. Light from the atmosphere is fed by the scanner unit consisting of an azimuth and an elevation scanner into the telescope which directs it onto the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The spectrometer contains a pre-disperser which separates the light into three spectral bands followed by a series of dichroic mirrors which further divide the light into a total of eight channels. A grating is located in each channel to diffract the light into a high resolution spectrum which is then focused onto eight detectors. The pre-disperser also serves as a Brewster window to separate polarised light, a part of which is sensed by the Polarisation Measurement Device (PMD). The output of the PMD is later used to correct for the polarisation effects. SCIAMACHY has a resolution ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 nm, and operates in wavelengths over the range 240 to 1700 nm, and 2000 to 2400 nm.

SDN:L22::TOOL1040,http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1040/,Optical Spectrograph and infrared Imager System,"The Optical Spectrograph and infrared Imager System (OSIRIS) is a limb-scanning spectrometer. It measures vertical profiles of spectrally dispersed, limb-scattered sunlight from the upper troposphere into the lower mesosphere to produce height profiles of O3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and stratospheric aerosols. It operates in the visible, near-infrared and near-ultraviolet spectrums.  The OSIRIS instrument is essentially two optical subsystems, suggested by its name: an optical spectrograph (OS) module and an infrared imager (IRI) module. The OS is a grating spectrometer with a CCD (charged coupled device) detector. Vertical profiles of the limb radiance are obtained by taking OS exposures while performing a repetitive vertical scan of the single line-of-sight through selected tangent altitude ranges (10 - 100 km). The IRI is composed of three vertical near infrared co-aligned linear array imagers that capture one-dimensional images of the limb radiance with a tangent altitude resolution of approximately 1 km. The imagers have parallel bore-sights; each one consists of an identical baffling system, lens, narrow-band interference filter, and a one-dimensional linear array of 128 thermo-electrically cooled photodetectors placed in the focal plane of the lens. Approximately 30 photodetector elements at one end of each array are covered with a mask in order to provide a continuous measure of the dark signal in the array. Therefore there are approximately 100 lines of sight from each imager channel that measure simultaneously over 100 vertical kilometres in tangent altitude. OSIRIS (OS) has a spectral range of 280 - 800 nm and a spectral resolution of 1 nm when at an altitude range of 5 -100 km. Each scan takes 40 - 70 seconds. The OS also has a minimum sensitivty of 12 kR per Angstrom per pixel. The IRI captures images of the limb radiance at at 1260, 1270, and 1530 nm and has a sensitivity of 50 kR per band per pixel.

Incoming light is split into two beams which propagate in separate optical paths to create an optical path difference. The beams then recombine to cause interference. FTS measures the intensity of interference by continuously changing the optical path length difference. A spectrum is obtained by performing a Fourier transform on the measured data. Light reflected from the earth's surface is observed in the spectral bands 1 through 3 of FTS during daytime, and the light emitted from the atmosphere is captured in band 4 during both day and night time. Prior to reaching the detectors of the instrument, the light in the bands 1 through 3 is split into two orthogonally-polarised components (P and S components) and measured independently. The light in the band 4, however, is not split. The instrument thereby observes the incoming light in seven different channels. The TANSO-FTS instrument operates within four spectral bands in the following wavelength ranges: 0.758-0.775 micrometres (band 1); 1.56-1.72 (band 2); 1.92-2.08 (band 3); 5.56-14.3 (band 4).

The SSM/I consists of an offset parabolic reflector of dimensions 24 x 26 inches, fed by a corrugated, broad-band, seven-port horn antenna. The reflector and feed are mounted on a drum that contains the radiometers, digital data subsystem, mechanical scanning subsystem, and power subsystem. The reflector-feed-drum assembly is rotated about the axis of the drum by a coaxially mounted bearing and power transfer assembly (BAPTA). All data, commands, timing and telemetry signals, and power pass through the BAPTA on slip ring connectors to the rotating assembly. The absolute brightness temperature of the scene incident upon the antenna is received and spatially filtered by the antenna to produce an effective input signal or antenna temperature at the input of the feed horn antenna. The SSM/I has seven channels, four frequencies, and is orthogonally polarised. It rotates continuously about an axis parallel to the local spacecraft at 31.6 rpm and measures the upwelling scene brightness temperature over an angular range of 102.4 degrees at nadir. The active scene measurements lie +51.2 to -51.2 degrees about the forward (F10, F11) or aft (F8) direction. This results in a swath width of approximately 1400 kilometres.

The blue light from the sources enters the water volume at an angle of approximately 55-60 degrees with respect to the end face of the unit. Fluoresced light is received by a detector positioned where the acceptance angle forms a 117-degree intersection with the source beam. A red interference filter is used to discriminate against the scattered blue excitation light. The red fluorescence emitted is synchronously detected by a silicon photodiode. The ECO uses three LEDs (modulated at 1 kHz) for source light. The source light enters the water volume and scattered material is detected by a detector positioned where the acceptance angle forms a 117-degree intersection with the source beam. Figure 3 shows the optical configuration for the ECO-BB2F. The instrument has an operational temperature range of 0 - 30 degrees Celsius, and a depth rating of 600 m."

The sensor uses a platinum microelectrode and a counter electrode (thus far composed of copper). A measurement potential is applied to the microelectrode relative to a counter electrode, reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water and generating a current through the microelectrode proportional to the number of oxygen molecules at that electrode. The sensor was first used in 2000 and development is ongoing. Early versions of the instrument applied the measurement potential for up to 30 seconds, with sampling starting approximately one second after the potential was applied. The sensor response to oxygen remained almost constant for a given concentration and data could be sampled at frequencies exceeding 1 Hz. To reduce noise generated by sensitivity to flow fluctuations a mesoporous layer was used to increase the surface area of the microelectrode, but this proved unstable and was replaced by a stop-flow system which pumped water in to a very small chamber, with measurements being taken while the water was still. This significantly improved results but the sensor was still affected by small convection currents. The current version of the sensor only applies the measurement potential for a few 10s of milliseconds and data are collected at approximately 1 Hz in an attempt to minimise the effects of convection currents. The latest development is a very small sensor head containing an array of microelectrodes (currently an array of five) that work together. The counter electrode consists of silver or silver chloride. This is currently undergoing trials and is yet to be deployed on a CTD profiler."

OMI is designed to monitor recovery of the ozone layer by measuring different aerosols (smoke, dust, sulfates) and other criteria pollutants such as O3 (ozone), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), BrO (bromine) and chlorine dioxide (OCLO). The OMI observes Earth's solar backscattered radiation in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums with a wide-field telescope, using hyperspectral imaging in a push-broom mode. This feeds two imaging grating spectrometers, each of which employs a charged coupled device (CCD) detector. Onboard calibration includes a white light source, LEDs, and a multi-surface solar-calibration diffuser. A depolariser removes the polarisation from the backscattered radiation. The OMI has a 13 x 24 km spatial resolution which can be zoomed to 13 x 13 km for detecting and tracking urban-scale pollution sources. The OMI employs three spectral bands, with wavelengths detected in the visible spectrum from 350 - 500 nm (band 1) and wavelengths detected in the ultraviolet spectrum from 270 - 314 nm (band 2) and  306 - 380 nm (band 3).

The TMI design is based on the SSM/I, detecting microwave energy in the form of of brightness temperatures from Earth's surface and atmosphere. It measures this at five separate frequencies. TMI consists of nine separate total-power radiometers, each simultaneously measuring the microwave emission coming from the Earth's surface with the intervening atmosphere. TMI employs an offset parabolic reflector (antenna aperture size of 61 cm) to collect the microwave radiation. The reflector focuses the radiation into two feedhorn. The reflector and feedhorns spin as a unit about an axis parallel to the S/X nadir direction. A cold-space mirror and a warm reference load are attached to the spin axis and do not rotate. The rotating feedhorns observe the fixed cold mirror and warm load once each scan for calibration purposes. The TMI measures radiation intensity at 10.7, 19.4, 21.3, 37 and 85.5 GHz.

A high speed rotating flow is established within a vertical cylindrical or conical container, where the stream to be separated is fed in the top (wide) end, flows helically around the container to the bottom (narrow) end and then exits the cyclone in a straight stream through the centre and out the top. Instead of following the flow of the stream, the inertia of large (dense) particles causes them to hit the sides of the container and fall to the bottom, where they can be removed. The cyclone geometry and flow rate define a cut point, which is the size of the particle that will be removed from the stream with 50% efficiency.

Functioning in one of two operational modes (ocean or ice), the Radar Altimeter provides information on significant wave height, surface wind speed, sea surface elevation which relates to ocean currents, the surface geoid and tides, plus various parameters over sea ice and ice sheets. RA operates by timing the two-way delay for a short duration radio frequency pulse, transmitted vertically downwards. The required level of accuracy in range measurement calls for a pulse compression (chirp) technique. In ocean mode a chirped pulse of 20 microsecond duration is generated with a band width of 330 MHz. For tracking in ice mode an increased dynamic range is used, obtained by reducing the chirp bandwidth by a factor of four to 82.5 MHz, though resulting in a coarser resolution. RA operates in the Ku-band at 13.8 GHz, with an accuracy in range better than 10cm. Flown on ERS-1, ERS-2. https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/ers/instruments/ra"

RA-2 also measures the power and the shape of the reflected radar pulses.  It's design is based on the heritage of ERS-1 Radar Altimeter (RA). RA-2  transmits frequency modulated pulses (chirp) pulses. This frequency modulation is a coding of the signal which spreads the energy of a short pulse over a longer time interval, thus allowing reduced peak power in the pulse. The transmit pulses, which are generated in the chirp generator (by means of SAW  RAC) are amplified by either Ku-band or S-Band amplifiers, depending on the selected transmit frequency. The Ku-band HPA uses a traveling wave tube whilst the S-band transmitter applies the solid state technology. The Ku-band front end electronics (KFEE) or the S-band front end electronics (SFEE) feed the signals to be transmitted to the antenna which is designed as a dual-frequency parabolic antenna.  RA-2  operates at 13.575 GHz (Ku-band) and 3.2 GHz (S-Band) and at high precision at less than a nanosecond. It measures the power level and time delay of 128 samples of echoes from ocean, ice, and land surfaces. It is optimised to maintain the leading edge of this echo in the range window.

The Poseidon-3 altimeter emits pulses at two frequencies  to measure the distance from the satellite to the surface (range). Free electrons in the atmosphere can delay the signal's return, affecting the measurement accuracy. The delay is directly related to the radar frequency, so the difference between the two measurements can be used to determine atmospheric electron content. Poseidon-3 is coupled with Doris/Diode, to improve measurements over coastal areas, inland waters and ice. Poseidon-3 emits pulses at 13.6 and 5.3 GHz in the C band, with pulse duration at 105 microseconds.

It was a low-power, low-mass test-bed for future space-borne altimeters. SSALT consists of two packages: the processing and control unit (PCU), and the radio frequency unit (RFU). SSALT sends a pulse generated by a surface acoustic wave generator with a 300 MHz bandwidth and 900 MHz frequency to the sea surface. The pulses are amplified before transmission, and frequency converted to 13.65 GHz after generation. The received pulses are also amplified and an FFT (fast fourier transform) analyser computes the power spectrum of the signal. The signal is sent through a microprocessor which performs the waveform computations to produce the output data.

SDN:L22::TOOL1064,http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1064/,Active Microwave Instrument,"An active microwave instrument consisting of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and a wind scatterometer (SCAT), the former designed to capture imagery of ocean, land and ice at high resolution and independently of weather conditions, and the latter utilised to measure horizontal wind speed and wind vector over the surface, as well as soil moisture and sea-ice type. The SAR radar operates by obtaining strips of imagery in two modes: the imaging mode, and the wave mode. In imaging mode, SAR provides two-dimensional images between (6 - 30)m along-track at a spatial resolution of 26m. In wave mode, imagettes of 5 km by 5 km in size are captured at regular intervals of 200 km along track; the imagettes are then processed within the swath to obtain the wave spectra, as changes in radar reflectivity on the sea surface are proxies for length and direction of surface waves. SCAT is composed by three sideways-looking antennas which generate radar beams at 45, 90 and 135 degrees azimuth across a swath 500 km wide situated 200 km to the right of the sub-satellite track. The radar backscatter is then measured for overlapping cells of 50 km resolution, using a grid spacing of 25 km. This technique permits three different viewing directions almost simultaneously, facilitating the determination of surface wind vectors. SAR and SCAT can be operated together, unless SAR is in imaging mode. The wave direction detected range is (0 - 180) degrees, at an accuracy of +/- 20 degrees; the detected wavelength range is (100 - 1000) m, with an accuracy of +/- 25%. AMI-SAR operates at the C-band frequency of 5.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 15.5 MHz, using vertically polarised antennas. The spatial resolution achieved is 30 m over a 100 km swath, located 250 km to the right of the sub-satellite track; the look angle is 23 degrees. Wind direction detected range is (0 - 360) degrees, at an accuracy of +/- 20 degrees; wind speed detected range is (4 - 24) m/s, at an accuracy of 2 m/s and spatial resolution of 50 km. AMI-SCAT operates at the C-band frequency of 5.3 GHz +/- 200 kHz. Flown on ERS-1, ERS-2. http://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/instruments/view/23; https://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/instruments/view/24"

The instrument operates as an active remote sensing device, emitting microwave pulses in the C-band frequency range (2 GHz - 4 GHz) and recording the response reflected by the Earth's surface targeted. The time it takes for each emitted pulse to return to the instrument holds information on the distance of the target object, whilst the amount of the signal returned is used to extract information on surface properties. ASAR operates in five mutually exclusive modes, which output images of different sizes and spatial resolution. The instrument is able to create orthogonal polarised waves, the return signal of which can be used to extract information on the type of surface targeted. The user can select an operating mode out of five mutually exclusive options: the Image mode (IM), generating products at a spatial resolution of 30 m over one of seven selectable swath widths determined by incidence angles between 15 degrees to 45 degrees, at horizontal transmit and receive polarisation (HH) or vertical transmit and receive polarisation (VV); the Alternating Polarisation mode (AP), generating products at a spatial resolution of 30 m over one of seven selectable swath widths determined by incidence angles between 15 degrees to 45 degrees, at different dual polarisation combinations (HH/VV or HH/HV or VV/VH); the Wide Swath mode (WS), which uses the ScanSAR technique, thus providing images at 150 m resolution over five combined sub-swaths covering a total of 405 km, in HH or VV polarisation; the Global Monitoring mode (GM), outputting 1 km resolution images over a 405 km swath, in HH or VV polarisation; and the Wave mode (WV), which generates backscatter vignettes of 5 km by 5 km size, spaced 100 km along track in HH or VV polarisation.

SDN:L22::TOOL1088,http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1088/,Synthetic Aperture Radar X-band,"SAR is an active system that transmits a beam of radiation in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to create images of a targeted object. Its application in remote sensing allows the mapping of the Earth's surface. An antenna sends successive pulses of radio waves to a target scene, and receives and records the echo of each pulse. AS the satellites moves along track, the antenna records successive target scenes thus forming the 'synthetic antenna aperture'. Signal processing of the recorded scenes allows the creation of higher resolution images. Data collection is independent of light and heat, and is therefore possible day and night, under any weather condition. TerraSAR-X operates in three alternate operating modes: SpotLight, giving 1 m resolution for a surface area of 5 km by 10 km; StripMap, giving 3 m resolution for a surface area of 30 km by 50 km; and ScanSAR giving 16 m resolution for a surface area of 100 km by 150 km.

It measures in the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared spectrums over nine spectral bands.  The OLI uses long detector arrays (of over 7000 detectors per spectral band) aligned across its focal plane to view across the swath. A four-mirror anastigmatic telescope focuses incident radiation onto the focal plane while providing a 15 degree field of view (FOV). Periodic sampling of the cross-track detectors as the observatory progresses along a ground track forms the multispectral digital images. The detectors are divided into 14 modules arranged in an alternating pattern along the centreline of the focal plane. The spectral differentiation is achieved by interference filters arranged in a butcher-block pattern over the detector arrays in each module. Silicon PIN (SiPIN) detectors collect the data for the visible and near-infrared spectral bands (bands 1 to 4 and 8) while Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MgCdTe) detectors are used for the shortwave infrared bands (bands 6, 7, and 9). The OLI has a swath width of 185 km and produces images with a 30 m multi-spectral spatial resolution. The wavelengths of the nine spectral bands are 0.433-0.453 micrometres, 0.450-0.515 micrometres, 0.525-0.600 micrometres, 0.630-0.680 micrometres, 0.845-0.885 micrometres, 1.560-1.660 micrometres,  2.100-2.300 micrometres,  0.500-0.680 micrometres and 1.360-1.390 micrometres.

This instrument is designed to measure distance to the seabed, but it can also be used in other underwater applications where distances need to be measured and monitored. The device is designed to be mounted on ships, boats, ROV, etc. Some of the applications include ROV and AUV Altitude, Heading and Attitude, Scour Monitoring, Hydro-graphic Survey, Touchdown Monitoring, Wave Height Measurement, Under Ice Measurement, Equipment Deployment, Motion Reference, Underwater Positioning. In addition to Altitude, the ISA500 provides Heading, Pitch and Roll as well as Temperature. Heading, Pitch and Roll readings are provided a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) sensor located within the unit. Temperature is measured by a sensor, which sits against the ISA500 end cap. The ISA500 falls into a category of a sonar, as it relies on underwater acoustics in ranging purposes. It operates by transmitting an acoustic pulse into the water, which travels until it comes into contact with the seabed. Upon contact with the seabed, part of the pulse is absorbed, and part is reflected back to the transmitter, which records the time between transmitted and reflected signal. Knowing the speed of sound in water and the time between transmitted and received (reflected) signal, once can calculate the distance. The key characteristics of ISA500 include: ranging capabilities (1-120+ m) with 1 mm resolution; heading, pitch and roll; temperature. Optional configurations include: depth rating of 1000m, 6000m or 11000m; housed in a compact titanium or lightweight acetal housing; available in forward looking and right angle housing configurations; Pitch, Roll and Heading (AHRS).
